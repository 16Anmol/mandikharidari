ðŸš€ MANUAL INSTALLATION STEPS FOR TAAZABAZAAR

Since you don't have package-lock.json, follow these simple steps:

1. Clean the project:
   - Delete node_modules folder (if it exists)
   - Delete .expo folder (if it exists)

2. Clear npm cache:
   npm cache clean --force

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install --legacy-peer-deps

4. Start the project:
   npx expo start --clear

5. Important: 
   - Completely restart your Expo Go app (force close and reopen)
   - The app should now work with SDK 53

If you still get errors, try:
   npm install --force

Alternative if nothing works:
   npx create-expo-app@latest TaazaBazaarNew --template blank-typescript
   (Then copy your source files to the new project)
